I am a software engineer with passion for making things. I spend most of my time writing software at whatever company
I am employed at but I am open to working together on something if there is great potential. I am very proficient in frontend
development, primarily React & Typescript but I also have a background in computer graphics game development. I really
enjoy combining all of these if possible.
